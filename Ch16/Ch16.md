## Monitoring, troubleshooting and disaster recovery

We talked about deploying to production in the previous chapter, but just _being_ in production is only half the job. 
The other half is ensuring that your systems are up, running and answering queries faster than your SLA thresholds. 

In this chapter, we'll cover how to tell that your RavenDB cluster is healthy, how to monitor its 
state over time and what to do if any issues pop up.

Even before getting the production deployment ready, you need to plan how you'll monitor what's going on in 
RavenDB. The first thing you'll see when you go to the RavenDB Studio in a browser is the dashboard view, giving
you the most-important details about what's going on in this specific RavenDB instance. This dashboard shows you crucial details, such as the number of requests, CPU load, memory utilization, indexing rate, etc. 

The dashboard view was designed so you can just throw it on a monitor somewhere and take a peek every so often to measure
the health of your system. If you have nothing else to guide you, just looking at the dashboard should still give you
some idea about what's happening on a particular node.

The problem with relying on _only_ the RavenDB dashboard is that it's limited to what's going on only right now, and only on one 
node. This view isn't so useful if you want to capture aggregated statistics across your cluster, for example, including historical
information and an analysis of the patterns over time. For that, you need a dedicated monitoring system. 

RavenDB doesn't attempt to build a full-blown monitoring solution in the dashboard, only to show you the most-pertinent information. The expectation is that you'll plug RavenDB into your existing monitoring solutions. Let's 
now explore what kind of hooks are provided for you to do just that.

### Ongoing monitoring

The most obvious monitoring option is to use SNMP.^[Simple Network Management Protocol]
To configure SNMP in RavenDB you'll need to set it up in the way shown in Listing 16.1.

```{caption="Setting up SNMP using the settings.json configuration file" .json}
{
    "Monitoring.Snmp.Enabled": true,
    "Monitoring.Snmp.Port": 161,
    "Monitoring.Snmp.Community": "password"
}
```

Once you have the configuration options from Listing 16.1 in the `settings.json` file, restart the node. You can 
now start querying RavenDB's internal state using SNMP. For example, the command in Listing 16.2 fetches the server update from the public RavenDB test instance. 

```{caption="Getting the live instance server update via SNMP" .bash}
$ snmpget -v 2c -c ravendb live-test.ravendb.net 1.3.6.1.4.1.45751.1.1.1.3

iso.3.6.1.4.1.45751.1.1.1.3 = Timeticks: (84790246) 9 days, 19:31:42.46
```

The key parts of these commands are:

* `-v 2c` - the protocol version (RavenDB uses RFCs 1901-1908)
* `-c ravendb` - the community string, which in this case is `-c password`, etc. (in the case of the public instance, the default `ravendb` is used)
* `live-test.ravendb.net` - the hostname, which in this case is the live instance (plug your own 
  instance URL here, of course)
* `1.3.6.1.4.1.45751.1.1.1.3` - the OID to query, which in this case is the server uptime

The output of the command in Listing 16.2 is the server uptime, fetched via SNMP.  We told RavenDB that we wanted this particular value using the OID in the command.
OID stands for Object Identifier, which is a way to globally name a particular value. The 
[`1.3.6.1.4.1.45751`](http://oidref.com/1.3.6.1.4.1.45751) prefix belongs to RavenDB, and anything nested under it denotes a particular value that can be queried. Don't worry, you don't have to memorize all these OIDs. Instead, you can simply
ask RavenDB for a list of any that are supported for a particular instance, by calling the `/monitoring/snmp/oids` endpoint on your server. For the live test server, that would be [http://live-test.ravendb.net/monitoring/snmp/oids](http://live-test.ravendb.net/monitoring/snmp/oids).

The `/monitoring/snmp/oids` endpoint can be very helpful because it also gives you the OID for specific values in specific databases. For 
example, the `1.3.6.1.4.1.45751.1.1.5.2.2.2.1` OID can be used to tell us the size (in megabytes) of a particular database.
This can make it very easy to plot all sorts of interesting values over time. You can also use SNMP to monitor 
the index rate of a specific index in a specific database. The amount of details and control you have is extensive.

Of course, you won't usually querying SNMP OIDs using `snmpget`. You'll instead plug in directly a monitoring solution like Zabbix, Nagios, SCOM, OpenView, etc. The online documentation has a few walkthroughs for setting up common scenarios, but I'll assume you're familiar with your own monitoring systems and skip any further hand-holding at this point.

> provides will paint only part of the picture. 

Beyond using SNMP, RavenDB also exposes a lot of the state in REST endpoints, outputting `JSON` that you can use. 
These are meant both for humans to look at during troubleshooting and for automated systems to scrape and store over time. 
Most monitoring solutions have a way for you to provide a URL and a way to fetch the interesting values from the response.
For example, Zabbix supports `JSON Path` queries from `JSON` data sources. 

You can get the full list of the debug endpoints from your server's `/debug/routes` endpoint. (For the live test server
this URL would be [http://live-test.ravendb.net/debug/routes](http://live-test.ravendb.net/debug/routes).) Just like any
other endpoint in RavenDB, when running in a secure mode, you'll need to provide authenticatation using a client certificate. 
Each monitoring solution has a different way of specifying this authentication, so check your user's manual for more details.

#### What should be monitored?

Now that we know how to _get_ the values to monitor, the obvious question is: What _should_ be monitored? I'm afraid that this is a hard question to answer, as it depends on your actual usage and needs. CPU load, memory, network and 
disk I/O are the most obvious things that you want to pay attention to. The numbers of requests and writes are also very interesting in most cases. 

> **Why not just monitor _everything_?**
>
> You can most certainly capture and store all the values that RavenDB and the machines expose. The problem there 
> is that most of this information isn't relevant for most scenarios. So, you might end up with a needle-in-a-haystack situation when you're looking for something specific. It would be easy overlook the pertinent information if you're drowning in so many other details.

At the very least, you definitely want to monitor values like the number of alerts for each of your databases. But seeing the 
time since the last query for each index probably isn't worth it. 

The general recommendation is to start with the basic template (see the online documentation for more 
 on that) and add more details as you see fit. A lot of these details depend on whether you're 
seeing any signs of trouble and are hoping to head them off early on.

This is vague advice, I realize. But the problem is that good advice is hard to give when speaking in generalities. One
scenario may call for a B2B system with a fairly constant load, so that seeing CPU percentage go too low or too high would be a 
a strong indicator of an issue. But for another scenario, such as a user-facing system with hardly any activity lunchtime, a 
spike in CPU usage at 9 AM every single workday would be normal. 

There is simply no substitution for knowing your environment and what's expected. Once you know that, you can
set thresholds for alerting the operations team when the monitored values go out of their expected range. Some
monitoring tools can even analyze the data on their own and detect and report when there are irregularities for you. 

#### Performance hints and alerts

RavenDB itself is constantly monitoring its own health. This includes measuring I/O latencies, conenctivity
to other nodes in the cluster, the amount of memory and disk available, etc. For some of these values, RavenDB
will take action on its own. For example, if the memory is low, RavenDB will switch gears and activtely try to reduce 
its memory usage to avoid running out of space completely. 

Most of the time, however, there isn't much that RavenDB _can_ do. For example, if the backup folder is out of free space or if RavenDB is experiencing slow I/O, all RavenDB can do is alert you to these troublesome details. Such issues appear as performance hints and alerts, as shown in red in Figure 16.1.

![Alerts and performance hints give your operations team ideas about what to look into.](./Ch16/img01.png)

Alerts are issues that RavenDB encounters that require some sort of manual intervention. These may be something simple,
such as running out of disk space or network issues with talking to a particular database. Sometimes the errors are 
transient, which is common in network scenarios. Alerts are also generated for your perusal even if the actual 
error was already fixed (a connection resumed between the nodes, for example) because investigating what happened
after the fact can still be useful.

> **Alerts are node-local.**
>
> An alert isn't a cluster-wide notification. Indeed, in many cases, you'll be alerted that a node is unable to 
> talk to the rest of the cluster. As such, you need to monitoring each node in the cluster and check its state
> whenever an alert appears. 

Performance hints, on the other hand, are different (see the blue in Figure 16.1). While they don't denote errors, 
they do very likely warrant your attention. RavenDB generate such hints for various reasons, such as the slow I/O example
in Figure 16.1. Other reasons include queries that return very large numbers of results without using streaming, 
slow requests, high fanout during indexing and a few other common issues.

These issues aren't typically too severe, but they're still better to address early on. Hints are generated 
whenever RavenDB detects a use pattern that is known to be problematic. For example, if your queries have a
very large page size or your documents are unusually large, then RavenDB identifies a potential for issues 
and is proactive in bringing these to your attention. 

In general, alerts are designed as an acknowledgement that no one reads the logs until it's too late. So, instead
of hiding errors in a text file that no one reads, RavenDB ensures that your operations teams knows about any big
stuff as they need to.

#### The debug log

Alerts are high-level items that needs operator attention. By design, very few things rise to the level of alerts, to
avoid spamming your operations team with too many cries for attention. That's where the debug log comes in.

RavenDB has just two log levels: `Operations` and `Information`. By default, RavenDB will log only messages 
with the `Operations` label. Operational log messages are things that the operations team needs to pay attention to
or be aware of, such as updating certificates, a failure to process commands, background tasks errors, etc. 

At the `Operations` level, the log output is meant to be readable and fairly shallow. You aren't informed about anything that
goes on inside RavenDB, only things that matter to the operations team. These are mostly errors and issues, even if they were transient or already worked around by RavenDB.

> **The audit log**
>
> In addition to the `Operations` level, RavenDB also supports an explict audit mode, where RavenDB records
> all database connections, their sources, their certificates used and their level of access granted.
>
> Certain special actions, such as the creation of a database or index, are also written to the aduit log. To enable the
> audit log, you can set a path to `Security.AuditLog.FolderPath`. For more details, see Chapter 13. 

The `Information` level, on the other hand, is much more detailed and will include anything that
goes in the database. This level can be helpful when tracking down a specific issue, but it generally results in a _lot_
of data. On a busy server, you can easily see a log file roll over after reaching its 256 MB limit in five to ten minutes.

By default, RavenDB retains log files for 72 hours. After that, these files are deleted. In many cases, 
you'll have a logs agent who monitors the directory and sends the logs to a central location, which means you can 
delete the logs file as soon as RavenDB starts a new one.

The logs location is controlled by the `Logs.Path` configuration option, and the general recommendation is to have RavenDB
write the logs to a separate hard disk. This is to avoid the case of setting the `Logs.Mode` to the 
`Information` level and having the logs fill up the RavenDB data disk completely. If you do change the logs path or mode, a server restart is required. 

But these logs aren't the only ways to get information from RavenDB.

### Finding out what your server is doing

If you run into issues with RavenDB, it might be too late to set up logging and monitoring. Recognizing this reality,
RavenDB is designed to have a lot of knobs to tweak and places to peek into under the hood on a regular basis. But this does _not_ mean you
can skip setting up a proper monitoring regime. The techniques outlined in the section are nonetheless very useful when trying to 
understand the behavior of RavenDB.

In many cases, these techniques can help you pinpoint what's going on very quickly. Monitoring, on the other hand, gives you 
insight into the behavior of the system over time and alerts you if something is out of whack. Any production cluseter is expected to have a proper monitoring strategy.

The RavenDB Studio does provide explicit support to help you figure out what's going on. The first place to look is
inside `Manage Server` and the `Debug` section, shown in Figure 16.2.

![The `Debug` section is your first stop to figure out what's going on the inside.](./Ch16/img02.png)

These options are only available to the operations team (requiring `Operator` or `Cluster Admin` privileges).
This is because they contain data for the entire server, not for a particular database. A standard user will not be
able to use these features. 

Let's explore each one of these options in turn.

#### The admin logs view

The easiest way to figure out what's going on inside RavenDB is to use the `Admin Logs` feature. This lets you 
hook into the logs stream generated by RavenDB and view it in a browser—a very convient option, because it doesn't require you to do anything to the server.

Even if the server is configured to not log anything, going to the `Admin Logs` page will start streaming the log
entries to you at the `Information` level. This means that you can enable the logs and watch them only during interesting
periods, instead of having them on all the time (or having to restart the server to change the logs mode).

> **`rvn logstream`**
>
> From the command line, if you're running on the same machine as RavenDB, you can use the `rvn logstream` command
> to have the same effect of seeing the logs steam on the console, but only for the pre-configured logging. 
> The `rvn admin-channel` command has an option to enable logging on a live server on a temporary basis.

Errors will be highlighted in red, but note that many of them are actually expected and are handled by
RavenDB. So, don't let seeing some errors here alarm you. 

Note that debug level logging can cause the server to have to do a _lot_ more work. While convenient, this feature come with a 
potential performance penalty. In most cases, that isn't something to worry about. RavenDB uses a purpose built logging system
that was design for low overhead and high throughput. But if your system is on the verge of resource exhaustion, enabling the 
debug logs can cause noticable effect on the system.

#### The traffic-watch view

Looking at the logs can be fairly tedious, given how much information is being generated. In some cases, it's easier
to figure out what's going on by just looking at the requests being made. RavenDB offers a dedicated
view for that, as shown in Figure 16.3. 

![Watching live requests on a production database can be helpful in many cases.](./Ch16/img03.png)

In Figure 16.3 you can see each individual request, how much time it took and some statistics about all the 
requests captured during a specific session (number, min., avg., max. duration). This information can be very helpful if 
you want to figure out why something is slow or resulting in an error. You can also export the traffic capture for 
later analysis. 

#### The debug info package

By far, the most valuable tool for inspecting the state of RavenDB is the `Gather Debug Info` page. You can see how this
looks in Figure 16.4. 

![The `Debug Info` package gives us access to _all_ the RavenDB debug endpoints.](./Ch16/img04.png)

What this page does is give us the ability to generate—at the click of a single button—a snapshot of the current
state of the RavenDB instance or even the whole cluster. The result is a single `zip` file that you can send along 
with your support ticket or analyze offline at a later date.

I mentioned a few times before that RavenDB goes to great lengths to externalize its state. Even with this chapter— 
dedicated entirely to helping you figure out what RavenDB is doing—I won't have enough time or space to go
over all the details that are available. Some of them are extremely useful for a single, specific case. But usually 
you don't need to go over each and every one of them.

The ability to so easily capture the entire state at once means that if you _are_ in a bad state, you can quickly
see the current status of the system and immediately take potentially invasive action to fix it. The classic example
is rebooting the system, which will "fix" many issues. The problem is that if you do so, you'll also typically lose
crucial information about what went wrong and how to prevent it in the future. 

The `Debug Info` package allows you to retain all of that knowledge. It's also very useful if you need to contact
the RavenDB support team, since it saves a _lot_ of back and forth. 

#### Advanced details

The last item in Figure 16.2 is the `Advanced` option. This is where RavenDB puts details that can be very interesting but
aren't usually needed. Among them, we have two views, as shown in Figure 16.5.

![Advanced information about what's going on inside RavenDB](./Ch16/img05.png)

Figure 16.5 shows the details on the threads inside RavenDB. This information can tell you what exactly is costing you CPU time. 
The list is sorted by usage order, so threads that burn through a lot of CPU will show up first. In the case of Figure 16.5, you 
can see that the most costly thread is the `Voron Global Flushing Thread` (we'll discuss I/O, which is what this
thread is doing, later in this chapter), followed by an indexing thread. 

RavenDB typically names threads intuitively—according to what they do—which makes it easier for the operations team to quickly figure out what's costing you and to take action. 

Another interesting peek into the inside of RavenDB is offered by the `Cluster Observer Logs` view. In Chapter 7 we discussed how the RavenDB cluster observer assigns work and even automatically moves databases between nodes. Figure 16.6 shows the logs of such decisions, allowing you to examine and understand them.

![The cluster observer logs explain how the cluster makes decisions.](./Ch16/img06.png)

The logs in Figure 16.6 show that Node B was down, as well as at what point the cluster detected that this node's databases
caught up with the rest of the nodes in the database group. This allowed the cluster to move Node B from a rehab state
to a normal member state.

This view can be very useful for understanding how the system got into its current state and what has led the
cluster observer to make the decisions it did. This information is also logged, of course, but is usually much easier to 
see in a condensed form here than by searching through the log files. 

### I/O operations in RavenDB

As a critical part of its database, I/O _matters_ to RavenDB. In particular, I/O performance matters. A lot of problems in production can be tied directly to issues with I/O. And these issues typically come with one (or both) of the following:

* insufficent depth - when the I/O system can't handle the amount of data read/write fast enough 
* insufficent width - when the I/O system can't handle the number of concurrent read/write requests fast enough

Both these issues will end up looking like slow I/O. But their root causes are different. In the case
of insufficient depth, we have an I/O system getting requests that are too big for it. A good example is when you're trying to make a large write (greater than the buffer size, typically) and seeing very high latency.

> **Imagine I/O bandwidth as a shipping channel.**
>
> I use the terms depth and width here because of the following metaphor. Imagine a water channel that has ships
> going through it. If you have a ship that's heavily loaded, it would be sitting deep in the water. If the channel
> doesn't have enough depth, then this ship will repeatedly hit the bottom. 
> Bringing this idea back to our case, a "heavy" I/O request will usually still work, but _very_ slowly. 
>
> As for width, imagine a water channel with a lot of canoes going through it. The wider the channel, the greater number of
> canoes that can go through it at the same time. But if the channel has insufficent width, you're sure to see a traffic jam. 
> The same with I/O: If you have a lot of requests (even if they are individually very small) the I/O system might struggle 
> to serve them all.

If you're running on an HDD and making a lot of random reads, this task requires seeking, which is slow. For a single
continuous write, the HDD is wonderful (high depth). But for concurrent work, not so much (insufficent width).

If you ever wonder how to better spend your hardware budget, get better I/O—it will almost always be a good
idea. Given the way RavenDB handles memory, if you have a fast-enough disk (NVMe comes to mind) you can even get a machine
with less RAM in favor of getting higher end drives and faster I/O. For some scenarios, getting the memory-mapped data from 
NVMe disk can usually happen quickly enough that it doesn't _have_ to be in main memory for acceptable performance.

> **What should you look out for?**
>
> Watch the disk queue length. If this length grows, it's usually a sign that requests are waiting

>
> High disk queue length means that some form of action is required (upgrading hardware, increasing IOPS, changing
> the load pattern, etc). 

RavenDB will alert you if it detects slow I/O for writes (as you already saw in Figure 16.1). But for more detailed
I/O monitoring, you'll need to look in a few additional places. RavenDB makes this easy by gathering all I/O statsitics on 
writes in one place. In the RavenDB Studio, go to your database, then `Stats`, then `IO Stats`.
You can see how this looks in Figure 16.7.

![RavenDB's internal stats for I/O write operations, for a production database](./Ch16/img07.png)

There's an abundance of details in Figure 16.7, and it probably won't make sense in isolation. In the Studio, however, you can zoom in and out to inspect every detail in the performance graph. Doing so can give you tremendous insight into any specific
operation that RavenDB made.

The green bar at the bottom is the most important piece of data. There, you can see the costs of writes to the journal
file over time. Since a transaction can't be completed before writing its changes to the journal file, that's the 
critical hot path for any performance issues with slow writes. Any delay in completing the journal write will translate to delays
in returning write results to the users.

The size of each write indicates how long it took, and the color tells you how big it was. The darker the value, the 
bigger the write. In general, you want to see a healthy situation, involving mostly small (and therefor shown using light colors) 
and thin writes. Having a few wider and darker spots is also fine (although writing more may take longer, obviously), but if 
you see wider areas that are bright (small writes that took a long time), then these are usually signs that the I/O system is saturated.

In such cases, you want to turn to the operating system's own tools to figure out what's going on. Some ideas about
what you should be looking for and how to retrieve them are shown in Table 16.1.

|          |        Windows         |    Linux    |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|
| Tool     | `perfmon`              | `iostat`    |
| Counters | Disk Reads/sec         | `r/s`       |
|          | Disk Writes/sec        | `w/s`       |
|          | Avg. Disk Queue Length | `avgqusz`   |
|          | Avg. Disk sec/Transfer | `await`     |

Table: I/O monitoring tools and what metrics to look at

Table 16.1 is a good starting place to investigate why your system is showing slow I/O symptoms. You can also use the Resource
Monitor tool on Windows and `iotop` / `sysdig` on Linux to figure out what files exactly are taking up all your I/O.

In this section so far, we looked at how to gather information about what's going on—whatever it is—via RavenDB and
the `I/O Stats` graphs or through the operating system tools. Yet we're still missing how to make this information
actionable. To know what to do when you have I/O issues, we need to first understand how RavenDB uses I/O.

#### RavenDB I/O behavior

The graph in Figure 16.7 shows how RavenDB keeps track of its writes. In general, RavenDB writes mostly to documents and indexes. Each write goes first to the journal (the green bar in Figure 16.7) and then is flushed to the data file (blue bar). Every now and then RavenDB will sync the data to the disk (using `fsync`) to allow for reusing the journal files.

> **Flushing data and syncing to disk**
>
> RavenDB use the term `data flush` to describe the process of copying modified transaction data to the memory-mapped
> data file. This operation is typically very fast, since it works by copying _from_ memory _to_ memory, involving no
> disk I/O. Periodically, RavenDB will ensure that the data written to the data file actually resides on disk
> by calling `fsync`. This is called a `data sync`, and it's typically much more costly as an operation. 

Important to understand is that, within a given storage environment (the documents store for a database, or each
individual index), there can only be a single outstanding write, data flush or file sync. However, writing to the disk, 
flushing the data and syncing to disk can all run at the same time.

Each index is also a full-blown storage environment, meaning that each will have its own cycle of journal writes, data 
flushes and `fsync` calls. Each index also runs completely independently from other indexes and the documents store—when
you have multiple databases inside the same server, each database and index will also operate independently of and concurrently with the others. 

> **What about reads?**
>
> So far we've covered a lot of details about how RavenDB writes data. But what about reads? How are those handled? 
>
> All I/O operations in RavenDB use memory-mapped I/O. In other words, we let the operating system buffer the cache, to manage what lives in memory and when to read from the disk. In most cases, the operating system will know how to select an effective working set that will minimize the amount of I/O required for RavenDB.
>
> If that isn't the case—for example, if you don't have enough memory for your workload—you'll start seeing a high number of page faults. In particular, pay attention to _hard_ page faults. A few of these are to be expected, but seeing a spike in the hard page faults per second counter indicates a possible issue.
>
> If you're using a faster disk, you might not care about this issue. NVMe reads, for example, are fast enough that in some cases they replace the main memory. Or, you might be reading cold data because a new index was created that needs to go over existing documents.
> But in most cases, seeing high hard page faults per second indicates an issue and requires investigation. 

By default, RavenDB limits the number of concurrent syncs and flushes that are performed on a specific device, to avoid
overwhelming the disk with too many writes at the same time. This is controlled by the `Storage.MaxConcurrentFlushes` and
`Storage.NumberOfConcurrentSyncsPerPhysicalDrive` options. 

For the best performance, we recommend having each database use its own device. That way, they don't have to fight
for the same hardware resources. For the same reason, you can also dedicate specific drives for indexes or journals by
using symbolic links and junction points, as discussed in the previous chapter.

#### How the data is laid out on disk

After looking at how RavenDB uses I/O, the next obvious step is to look at how the data is actually stored on disk. Table 16.2 lists the files that are stored and how RavenDB uses each of them.

| Path        |                                                      Purpose                                                       |

| Indexes/    | Recursively holds the same structure (Raven.voron, headers.one, Scratch, Journal) for each of the indexes.         |

Table: File structure of a RavenDB database on disk

You can go to the RavenDB database directory to look at these files, but they won't really mean much. They hold binary 
data and are opaque to the user. 

> **Remember to exclude the RavenDB directories from indexing or antivirus scans.**
>
> If your machines have any kind of antivirus or file indexing services, you should exclude the RavenDB directories
> from them. That's because these services often add significant latency to the I/O.

> It's also common for these services to lock files, cause I/O failures and, in general, mess around in what

You can't really learn anything about the file structure from the file system. But you _can_ learn quite a bit from
asking RavenDB what's going on directly. In the RavenDB Studio, go to your database, then to `Stats`, then
`Storage Report`. Figure 16.8 shows what this storage breakdown looks like for a blog database.

![Internal storage detail for a blog database](./Ch16/img08.png)

The tree map in Figure 16.8 should help you figure out at a glance what's taking up space in your
database. Below the tree map, you'll see a table similar to our Table 16.3.

|   Type    |           Name            | Size (SUM 800.62 MB) | % Total |
|-----------|---------------------------|--------------------|---------|

| Index     | PostComments/CreationDate | 96 MB              | 11.99%  |
| Index     | Posts/ByTag               | 48 MB              | 6.00%   |
| Index     | Auto/Commenters/ByKey     | 34 MB              | 4.25%   |

Table: Detailed breakdown of disk size for each item inside a RavenDB database

You might notice that the numbers here are nice and round. That's quite intentional. An index in RavenDB
reserves a minimum of 16 MB on the disk. RavenDB also uses a pre-allocation pattern when requesting disk space from
the operating system. What does _that_ mean, you ask?

Asking the operating system for more disk space in small increments will result in major fragmentation of your files. Instead,
RavenDB asks for a file size increase upfront—starting with doubling the size of the data file on disk every time more
space is needed, until 1 GB is reached. After that, the data file grows by 1 GB at a time. This pattern gives the operating system the best chance for allocating continuous disk space for the file (and it reduces metaadata I/O overhead in most cases). 
 
You can see how the space is used in a particular item by clicking on it in the Studio, where the breakdown is shown between journals and data for that storage environment. Journals are used whenever a transaction is committed. These files are where RavenDB writes all the changes that happen in a transaction, ensuring that the data is stored in a persistent way and that the hot path of I/O is sequential writes, which is the fastest option.

Journal files are also pre-allocated in terms of space (starting at 64 KB and doubling in size to a max of 
256 MB^[All these sizes, as well as the max size of database's growth are configurable, of course.]). Whenever RavenDB is
finished using a particular journal file, it will not delete it, but instead reuse it, as needed. This saves the amount of on-disk
space allocated to the journals. RavenDB does rename the files to maintain consistent numbering, but the reuse of journals
makes sure that the file system allocation is otherwise unchanged.

Going back to the tree map, you can click on the `Datafile` entry to see the breakdown inside the actual database. Table 16.4 shows what this looks like for a blog database.

|   Type   |         Name          |    Size (SUM 256 MB)    | % Total |

| Reserved | Pre-allocated Buffers | 8 KB (out of 6.00 MB) | 0.00%   |

Table: Space usage breakdown for a 256 MB database hosting a blog

The information about space in this table is interesting. It's divided into tables, trees, reserved and free. Let's talk
about what each of these mean.

A table in this context is not a relational table, but rather an internal structure inside the low-level Voron 
storage engine. This is how RavenDB stores data internally. You can click `Tables` to see more about how much space
is used by each one, as shown in Table 16.5.

| Type  |                Name                | Entries | Size (SUM 156.22 MB) | % Total |

Table: Space breakdown of the storage tables inside a blog database

As you can see, a storage table is part of how RavenDB implements collections (for example, the `posts` collection
is using `Collection.Documents.posts`, `Collection.Tombstones.posts` and `Collection.Revisions.posts`). There are also other
tables, such as `Collections` and `AttachmentMetadata`, that are used inside RavenDB to implement its functionality. In 
general, you won't need to worry about how this is structured. Usually you'll look at this view only to figure out why you might be
using this much disk space. 

The `Trees` section is Table 16.4 is the amount of space used by internal storage indexes. Clicking on `Trees` shows you more details, but these details tend not to be interesting to operations people, since the indexes are only a small fraction of the data size and thus rarely matter. 

The `Reserved` section is reserved by RavenDB to ensure a high locality of reference internally—an implementation
detail that's used for optimizing access patterns. This section will never be very big, and you can safely ignore it. 

What's left in Table 16.4 is `free` space. And that takes a whopping 36.6% of the data. In this case, RavenDB is pre-allocating 
data from the file system. But the section can also refer to free space that RavenDB reclaims once data is deleted.

In general, you don't need to concern yourself with the actual management of the free space inside RavenDB. This process is handled completely internally, and deleted data will free space up for RavenDB to reuse as needed. This means that deleting a lot of documents and then inserting them again will result in disk space reuse. 

However, it's important to note that RavenDB does _not_ release free space back to the operating system itself. In other words, if you delete all the data inside a very large database, you won't get any on-disk space back. RavenDB will simply reuse this space as needed. 

If you do want RavenDB to give up this space, you'll need to take actually manually by compacting the database.

#### Database compaction

You can ask RavenDB to compact the database to its smallest possible size by using the `Compact database` option on the database page (see Figure 16.9).

![You can start a database compaction from the `Databases` view.](./Ch16/img09.png)

Compaction is an offline process, meaning it will take the database down temporarily (only on the 
node where you actually run the compaction) and re-create the database files from scratch. Note 
that this has the effect of reading and writing the entire database and can cause a signficiant 
amount of I/O. The process also requires enough disk space to create the compacted database clone
in addition to the current database.

Compaction reserves no additional free space from the operating system and can arrange the data on disk in a more optimal 
way. But unless you have an explicit need for the disk space that this process will free up, it's probably best to leave well enough alone. After all, RavenDB is designed run off as little operational overhead as possible, and managing the data on disk is one of its 
primary tasks. Any free space inside the data file is already going to be reused by RavenDB, so manual compaction is typically not worth the time. 

### Troubleshooting connection issues

After talking at length about disk I/O, let's turn our eyes to other I/O sources. In particular, the network is 
well-known for being a troublesome and finicky beast in this arena.

Actually delving into all the things that can go wrong in the modern network envrionment will take multiple books, so I'm
going to assume that you're at least familiar with the usual concepts.

The common network issues with RavenDB include:

* Firewalls, both at the network and machine level - Remember that RavenDB uses two ports for communication: one for
  HTTP(S) and one for TCP communication. If you didn't explicitly use the configuration `ServerUrl.Tcp`, RavenDB will use
  a dynamic port, which works inside a data center. In the cloud, for example, you'll instead need to set a fixed port 
  and define the firewall rules to allow it. 
* Latency - If you're deploying in a geodistributed manner or have high latency between nodes, you'll need to
  account for it in the RavenDB configuration. The setting `Cluster.ElectionTimeoutInMs` controls this behavior and
  is set to 300 ms by default. Note that this setting is meant for nodes deployed in the same data center, so you'll need to set it to a higher value on other configurations. Replication between database instances on different nodes isn't too sensitive to delays and was designed for deployment in high-latency situations, so you won't need to change anything there.
* Intrusive middleboxes - In many environments, a network connection goes through multiple network applicances, often 
  called middleboxes. These can be firewalls, intrusion detection systems, WAN optimizers, load balancers, etc. The
  problem with these middleboxes is that they often add behavior (and even modify the payload) and can result in unexpected results.
  Because RavenDB is almost always deployed in a secure configuration while in production, the communication to and from the
  server is encrypted and cannot be modified. This reduces the number of times that a network appliance can apply
  a tranformation to the TCP connection and break things.
* SSL termination - A special case of a middlebox is the SSL-terminating appliance. This is when a client uses SSL to connect to the
   endpoint, where the SSL connection is terminated and a plain HTTP connection is made from the applicance to RavenDB. This process is only possible when RavenDB is run without security—authentication requires a client certificate to reach the 
   RavenDB server, which obviously cannot happen if the SSL connection was terminated at the appliance level.
* TLS downgrade - Some appliances can only accept certain versions of SSL/TLS connections. RavenDB _requires_ you to use TLS 1.2 to connect and will show an error if a connection is attempted using TLS 1.0 or 1.1. 

Troubleshooting issues on the network usually means using low-level tools, such as packet inspectors likes `WireShark`. While I'm not 
going to go into the details of such tools, I want to point out that in many cases—especially for resolving issues in TLS/SSL connections—using `openssl s_client`^[Full documentation for this feature can be found in the 
[OpenSSL Cookbook.](https://www.feistyduck.com/library/openssl-cookbook/online/ch-testing-with-openssl.html).] 
can be much easier. The full command is `$ openssl s_client -connect a.oren.ravendb.run:443 -cert client.pem -key client.pem`.

The output of this command can tell you quite a lot about the connection. In particular, it can tell you whether the client successfully created a secured connection to the server, mutually authenticated and which certificates were used by either side. This command is a good way to pinpoint or rule out common issues at the beginning of your troubleshooting search. 

#### Internal, external and multiple IPs

When you run on your own hardware, the situation is pretty simple: Your server has _one_ IP address to listen to and that clients will use to talk to it. But when you run in the cloud, things get more complicated. Your server has both an internal IP to listen to (such as `172.31.25.240`) and a public IP (such as `52.9.72.38`)^[These are real internal and external IPs from one of our AWS machines.].

The server can't actually bind to `52.9.72.38`, because it isn't directly exposed to the network. Instead, any 
connection to this IP will be routed to the server by the cloud's network appliances. This leads to an interesting
problem, since the server needs to bind to an IP address so it can listen to incoming packets. This is the logic behind the `ServerUrl` and `PublicServerUrl` configuration settings. 

Normally, you'll want to set it to `0.0.0.0:443` to have RavenDB bind to all available network interfaces. However, the server often needs to tell clients and other servers how to talk to it, so we also need to provide the server with its publicly visible details. This is the `PublicServerUrl` setting (as well as `PublicServerUrl.Tcp`) come into play. It's important to remember to calibrate this setting properly—or else the server will tell clients to use its internal IP, which the outside world can't reach. (You'll usually establish this configuration during your initial setup. But if you're doing things manually, it can be easier to forget this step.)

RavenDB uses HTTPS for securing the communication, which means we also validate that the hostname used matches the
hostname on the certificate. Issues can occur if you attempt to connect to the server using a different hostname. For example, if your certificate was issued for `a.oren.ravendb.run`, any connection made with `https://rvn-srv-01` will fail, due to this hostname mismatch. On the client side, you can ignore this validation step, whether from the browser or client API (although doing so is not recommended). But on the server side, RavenDB will always validate the hostname, so it _must_ match the certificate's hostname for any server-to-server communication.

### The Admin JavaScript console

We've already covered quite a few of the ways that RavenDB externalizes its state and lets you poke around inside the server. Yet even beyond everything described above, RavenDB contains another option that's very powerful. As they say, with great power comes great responsibility.

Here's what you do: In the RavenDB Studio, go to `Manage Server` and then `Admin JS Console`. You can see how this looks in Figure 16.10.

![The Admin JS Console lets you run scripts against the current server instance.](./Ch16/img10.png)

This console unlocks a way to run scripts inside the server itself, giving you full access to anything going on inside. Figure 16.10 shows how we can use this process to retrieve data from the server. But much more is possible: You can also mutate the state of the server, including calling methods and interfering with the internal state.

The Admin JS Console comes with no safety net, nor a harness. You are absolutely able to do things there that would crash the
server or merely stop it from accepting additional requests. (This option is available to those who are experts in the internals of RavenDB. There's no documentation available on the API specifically—but there's also no promise of the compatability of your scripts between releases.) This tool is mostly meant to be used during support incidents, when you'll get directions for which scripts to run from a RavenDB support engineer, and when the ability to make changes to the server on the fly is invaluable. Otherwise, we don't recommend touching this tool in production. Nonetheless, it's always available via `rvn admin-channel`, which can connect to a running instance of RavenDB and perform operations directly from inside the server, bypassing the network layer. 

The `rvn` tool was mentioned briefly before, but I think it's time to talk about it now in more depth, as it's part of a larger disaster recovery strategy for RavenDB.

### Disaster recovery strategies

RavenDB is used in mission-critical systems and holds valuable information. Part of the very core 
of its design is to consider failure modes and reactions to them. 
There have been quite a few of such failures that we took into account, including both hardware 
issues and losing the admin certificate to your RavenDB instances. 

> **Maximize survivability: Run on a cluster, and avoid single points of failure.**
> 
> At a minimum—if you care about being up at all—you should always run RavenDB in a multi-node cluster. Running RavenDB on 
> a single node is something that should only be done during development or testing. In fact, all of RavenDB's high-availability
> features assume that you have multiple nodes to function.
> 
> Using the same logic, try to avoid having any single points of failure, such as a single SAN that all the nodes use for storing
> their data. If the SAN is down, then the entire cluster is down. 

It goes without saying that you should always develop a proper backup strategy (see the next chapter, dedicated to this topic).
But just having backups isn't enough. If you have a large database, even the time it takes to copy the backed-up data to the 
machine can take hours. Instead, you need multiple layers of defense to ensure that you'll always be online.

The first layer is running in a multi-node cluster and ensuring that each database has a high-enough replication factor to survive the loss of a node or two. The exact value of this replication factor depends on the size of your cluster and the importance of your data. The more important the data and the continued operation of the system, the more resources you should use. 

The next layer of defense is having an offsite clone of the data. This is usually defined using external replication and
is meant to serve as a live server that holds all your data—allowing you to manually fail over to it if you happen to lose _all_ the nodes in the cluster.

> **Paranoia? You mean common sense.**
>
> For high-value production systems, paranoia is just the way things are. You don't necessarily have to follow all the suggestions in this section. But know that we're safeguarding systems that must always be up and that seek to survive even the most unlikely scenarios. 
> 
> We also know that a cost is associated with such duplicated measures (an offsite hot node, backups, additional nodes in the cluster,
> etc). Part of any operations team's job is to weigh these costs against the acceptable level of risk to see if they're worth it. At some point, the risks become negligible and the costs prohibitive. To my knowledge, no one has yet to set up a server farm on the moon to handle the case of a thermonuclear war, for example. You need to make your own determination in the matter.

One other thing to note on this topic is that you can also set up a delay in external replication, which can give you time to react if you happen to run a query that modifies data that it shouldn't across a cluster. 

#### Admin access without the admin certificate

Imagine trying to get into your house, only to discover that you lost your keys. The same can happen to RavenDB if you
lose the admin certificate. A basic example is when an employee goes on vacation—with the admin client certificate locked on his or her 
machine. You don't have access to the certificate, but you desperately need to perform some admin operation. What can you do?

RavenDB follows a simple rule: If you have admin or `root` privileges on the box, then you can access RavenDB. As a root user,
you have a few options available to help you access RavenDB: You can use your root privileges to get the server certificate
that RavenDB itself is using to run. This certificate can also be used for client authentication.
If you authenticate as a client using the server's own certificate, RavenDB will always give you
full an unrestricted access to the server. 

In other words, if you can access the machine RavenDB is running on as root or administrator, then you can get the certificate
that RavenDB is using and then access RavenDB directly as admin. At this point, you could generate a new admin client certificate or perform any other action as needed.

> **The security of allowing root access**
>
> This kind of access raises the obvious question: Isn't this a security risk? Why should it be so easy for a root user to have full access to RavenDB?
>
> The answer is that it doesn't actually matter. If attackers have enough privileges to run as root users, then they also have
> enough access to do whatever else they want—inject code into the RavenDB process, read and write to its memory, etc. 
> 
> If there's no protection from the root user, then there's no point in making the operations team work any harder than necessary. 

In addition to getting the server certificate for client authentication, there's also the option to use the `rvn` tool. This tool is used for various tasks (such as the `rvn offline-operation` described in Chapter 13 for encrypting the server store) and in this case can also be run in the `rvn admin-channel` mode to use a named pipe for connecting to the server.

In particular, you can run commands that let you do thing like add a new client certificate, dig into statistics, force a GC collection, 
restart the server and even access the Admin JS Console discussed earlier in this chapter. 

The `rvn admin-channel` uses a named pipe, controlled by the operating system permissions. Only those with root or admin privileges
and the user who is running the RavenDB process have access to this named pipe and can send such commands to RavenDB.

#### Dealing with data corruption

Hardware does break and disks do fail—eventually, entropy will take us all. Yet I'll assume that you can get over the depressing reality of the previous statement and actually want to do something when such things happen. The scenario we'll deal with in this case is a bad sector, hardware failure or something similar that resulted in data corruption of the RavenDB on-disk files.

RavenDB uses hashing to ensure that the data has been successfully written to the disk. This allows RavenDB to detect if
there have been unexpected changes to the data.^[By default the hash function used is XXHash64, which is non-cryptographic. It doesn't provide any level of authentication. A malicious user that can modify RavenDB's on disk files can update the data and the hash without RavenDB ever knowing. 
When using an encrypted database, RavenDB uses cryptographic authentication to ensure that the data was modified only by someone who holds the secret encryption key.] In this way, data corruption can be detected and handled early on—before it has the chance to spread. RavenDB will mark a database with such an error as corrupted and shut it down.

If you're running in a cluster, the usual—and easiest—way to handle such a scenario is to replace the hard disk on the faulty node and
just let RavenDB replicate the data back to the node. But if you don't have the data on another node, you might need to take additional steps. 

The `Voron.Recovery` tool is designed for such cases. This tool reads a RavenDB database (data file and journals) and goes over all the data—one byte at a time. It doesn't rely on a file's structure and _assumes_ that the file is corrupted. It tries to recover as much data as possible by going over the raw data with a fine-tooth comb.

The output of this process is a set of `.ravendump` files (gzipped json, essentially) that contain all the recovered data as well
the list of errors that the tool encountered. You can import these `.ravendump` files into a new database to recover the documents.

### Routine maintenance

By design, RavenDB is not one to require regular maintenance. For most things, RavenDB will quite happily clean up after itself
and not require any human involvement in the process. Monitoring is the way to go here, to only alert you when things arise that
RavenDB can't recover from automatically.
Things like running out of disk space or having an index definition that failed to index too many documents are two examples of such issues. For those, you need monitoring, alerts and a human in
the loop to actually fix things.  

Most tasks, such as backups and ETL jobs, are defined only once and then executed by the cluster on its own, without the need for a babysitter. 

The most common task for an admin to do, in fact, is to go over the cluster's own to-do list and see whether all its tasks are still relevant. For example, the number of subscriptions on a database may be very large, but many of them haven't had a client for weeks or months. This doesn't actually _hurt_ anything, but it can be nice to trim such subscriptions to make it easier to see what's actually going on in your cluster.

### Summary

In this chapter, we've gone through the core details of keeping RavenDB running in production. A lot of these details involve simply setting up proper monitoring and alerts—if something happens that RavenDB isn't actually able to fix on its own. RavenDB doesn't need
a lot of regular maintenance, as it does most things automatically. However, when something does break, you want to have a red 
light flashing somewhere and a person to investigate it and help RavenDB recover. As a result, RavenDB offers a lot of 
features aimed specifically at enabling proper monitoring and externalizing its internal state to make the operations team's
job easier.

The first topic we discussed was SNMP monitoring, a protocol that is used by all operational monitoring systems to check
the state of servers and network services. RavenDB supports this protocol and exposes quite a bit of data to it for observation and analysis. You also have more detailed information available in JSON endpoints, giving you multiple ways to access and act on the data.

Beyond exposing its state, RavenDB also continuously performs analyses on it and makes decisions on what to do. In 
most cases, these actions are internal and reflect RavenDB's automatic adjustment to the environment. There are also cases
where RavenDB will issue alerts and performance hints for the operators to look at. 

The performance hints in particular should interest the operations team, because they can usually head off the system taking a problematic direction. The alerts are of more immediate concern, of course, but at that point the problem is likely more severe. Because the performance hints that show up today point to problems that may happen in a few weeks or months, it's best to take advantage of this lead time and take action on them early—before you have a crisis on your hands.

Routine monitoring of your application will let your team know when something is ... _off_. But you might need more information. So, we
looked at how to figure out what's going on inside the server. Tools such as admin logs and traffic watch give you immediate
insight into what's going on. Admin logs can enable logs to run on the fly, even if logging was disabled in the server configuration. Traffic watch lets you to observe the incoming requests and monitor latency and usage.

In most troubleshooting scenarios, however, you'll head directly to the debug info package. This view captures a snapshot of
all the details about the running server (or even the entire cluster) and puts them in a single zip file. The package makes it very 
convenient to explore the entire state of RavenDB at a given point in time. It's also useful to first capture the state of
the server, then restart it (which fixes most problem). You can do offline analysis of the package at your leisure, while 
restoring the system to full functionality as soon as possible.

We then discussed network and connection issues. We went over some common problems that may occur in your environment, in 
particular related to firewalls and other network appliances. The `openssl s_client` command is very useful in such scenarios,
since it gives you a simple place to start your investigation. We also discussd internal and external IPs and how to resolve a potential identity crisis for RavenDB when running in such an environment. We have to explictly tell RavenDB what IP to bind to and what hostname to direct clients to for their server connections. Otherwise we're likely to create confusion. 

The Admin JS Console is a way for you to run scripts directly inside RavenDB. Here, you can even mutate the internal
state of RavenDB (for example, to enable logging to a file without having to do a restart), but this access can also be dangerous, since 
you're literally modifying RavenDB in real time. 

The final topic we covered in this chapter is how to deal with disasters. RavenDB was explicitly designed to run in a hostile 
environment, where nodes may go down and hardware may fail. We went over several strategies to deal with such cases, mostly
by adding redundancies to handle these failures. There's also the `Voron.Recovery` tool that can extract data from a partially
corrupted RavenDB database if the hard disk itself has suffered a failure.

Even though we talked about disaster recovery, we haven't yet covered one crucial topic: the backup (and restore) of RavenDB. 
This is because the backup process is an important topic all its own and deserves a proper forum for discussion. The next chapter is dedicated to backups, and even more important, to how to restore your systems afterward.
